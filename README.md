# Time-Series-Forecast-for-Electricity-LMPs.
In colloboration with Southern Power Company, I completed a data science capstone project that focused on constructing a time series forecast for Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) within the day-ahead and week-ahead energy market.


# Project Introduction

## Company Introduction
Southern Power (SP) is dedicated to shaping the future of energy by investing in sustainable energy solutions for their customers. As a subsidiary of Southern Company, they are a prominent U.S. wholesale energy supplier catering to the electricity needs of municipalities, electric cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, and commercial and industrial clients.

## Business Model
Southern Power's business model focuses on acquiring, developing, building, and operating clean energy projects, including wind, solar, natural gas, and battery storage. They provide electricity to customers through long-term contracts and sell excess energy to the wholesale market. They also actively manage and optimize their portfolio of assets to maximize value for their customers and shareholders. Their goal is to deliver reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy to their customers and communities.

## Purpose of this project
The objective of this project is to enhance the efficiency of the business model for SP by addressing two separate energy markets: day ahead and real-time. To accomplish this, the project aims to create a statistical and machine learning model that will identify the key factors that contribute to the variability in energy availability.Once the significant factors are identified, the next step will be to use them to build an energy forecasting model. This advanced predictive capability will provide SPC with a competitive advantage in the market, allowing them to make more accurate predictions about the potential revenue from their renewable energy projects.With a clearer understanding of the market, SPC will be able to make more informed decisions about resource allocation and energy pricing, ultimately leading to increased profits and a stronger market position. Additionally, by prioritizing renewable energy, SPC will not only benefit financially, but also play a crucial role in promoting sustainability and reducing the impact on the environment.
